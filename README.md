### <ins>Project Background</ins>
The de-icing and anti-icing applications we apply to paved surfaces eventually make their way into streams and aquifers – increasing the salinity above healthy levels for people, fish and wildlife. At high concentrations, salt can be fatal to some aquatic animals. The presence of salt can also result in salty pockets forming near the bottom of a lake, which creates a biological dead zone.

With this in mind, the Road Salt Application was developed using the R shiny package to guide the NJDEP's Division of Water Monitoring in creating a one-stop dashboard with key statistics addressing this problem.

The data used for this project was collected from 3,644 monitoring stations throughout NJ for the years 1997-2018. There were three major pollutants that were measured: specific conductance, total dissolved solids, and chloride.
